# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

1.Add your API KEY in config.js.
2.Run npm install to install dependencies.
3.Run npm start.

I think the debouncing functionality which I have added in search fuctionality will prevent the network congestion.

If I had more time than I would have worked om styling.
